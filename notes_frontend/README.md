# Notes Frontend

An Angular notes application with create, edit, delete, list, and search functionality.

- Minimal, responsive UI with sidebar and detail/list layout
- Light theme with #1976d2 (primary), #424242 (secondary), #ffb300 (accent)
- All main code is in `src/app/components/`.
- To run: `npm start` (by default on port 3000)<br/>
  If port 3000 is already in use, start with a custom port using:<br/>
  `PORT=4200 npm start`
- To build: `ng build`

For advanced backend data, replace the local in-memory NotesService with HTTP implementation.
